# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "HoopCart Repository"
4. Check the following permissions:
   - repo (all)
   - workflow
   - write:packages
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **IMPORTANT**: Copy your token and save it securely. You won't be able to see it again.

## Step 2: Create a New Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name your repository (e.g., "HoopCart-Site-New")
3. Choose if it should be public or private
4. Don't initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license
5. Click "Create repository"

Once you have completed these steps, come back to the terminal with your:
1. New repository URL (https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepo.git)
2. Personal Access Token
